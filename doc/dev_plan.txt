All projects, coding and otherwise, boil down to two fundamental questions- what should we do, and how should we do it? Learning computer programming is largely about the latter. Implementing a large project is as much or more about the former.

Q: How do you eat an elephant?
A: One bite at a time.
Addendum: Which bites are taken when is key to success.

Having handled a couple of items it's a good time to re-visit the task list - remove completed items, add new ones, and figure out priorities for next steps.
- avatar interacts with the map (e.g. blocked by walls, can dig)
- advancement
- items & inventory
- the UI loop and timing
- mobs on the map (presence and interaction)
- mobs in general
- equipment
- key binding system
- help system (at the least, list available actions / commands)
- random tables (ways of selecting at random from a weighted and possibly dynamic set)

Now that at least one very basic mixin is working (WalkerCorporeal) it's time to handle mixins with state and how persistence is handled for them.

I'll create a very simple mixin called Chronicle which can be used to track information about an entity. For now it will simply track the number of moves the entity has made. This tracking will have to be called explicitly each time a move is made. Later I'll refactor this to use an event system instead - dealing with event stuff will require revisiting how mixins are added to an entity. However, for now I just need something that has enough state that I can figure out the persistence problem.

Actually I'll probably need a couple of stateful mixins to really make sure it's working, and same with the event stuff. I also realized I need a mixin to test out mixin-specific template info. I'll set up a HitPoints mixin as well to cover both those issues.

This seems like a decent point to add some utility stuff to map as well - getting a random spot on the map, and getting a random spot of a given type and/or attribute (e.g. a random floor tile location). It'll be nice to launch the game and have the avatar not start out embedded in a wall.
