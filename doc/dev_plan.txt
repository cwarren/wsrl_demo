All projects, coding and otherwise, boil down to two fundamental questions- what should we do, and how should we do it? Learning computer programming is largely about the latter. Implementing a large project is as much or more about the former.

A: One bite at a time.
Addendum: Which bites are taken when is key to success.

Some of the tasks that would need to be done for a full game aren't really necessary for a base game, so I'm (at least for now) setting them aside. I'm also far enough along that I'm going to put a bit of thought into ordering the milestone list at this point.
Base game:
- help system (at the least, list available actions / commands)
- mobs that attack the player, enhanced combat
- real game win / lose conditions
- map visibility limits; FOV, LOS, and all that jazz
- remembered map
- map modification - digging
- items & inventory; gamePlay sub-modes
- hunger, food, and eating
- equipment
- treasure drops
- improved map generation - random seeds for maps, seeding items
Later:
- ongoing actions
- avatar advancement - experience and improvement
- game scoring
- random tables (ways of selecting at random from a weighted and possibly dynamic set)
- multiple maps and moving between them
- improved map tiles and generation - more tile types, variable digging
- throwing things & ranged combat
- ipad compatibility


So, the next milestone is the help system. One of the initial questions I have to answer is whether it's going to use its own ui mode or whether it will be a sub-mode of gameplay. I'm leaning towards the former since I think I might want to claim some of the keys that would otherwise be used for game commands. As I think about it I realize that there are potentially many other situations in which I'll want to display a bunch of text to the player, so maybe I'll generalize the ui mode to textReading and work on supporting appropriate commands for that. Then I need to figure out how to generate appropriate help text from the key binding info.

Those two pieces seem like decent size chunks. I'll leave gameplay sub-modes for later.
