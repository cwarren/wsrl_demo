All projects, coding and otherwise, boil down to two fundamental questions- what should we do, and how should we do it? Learning computer programming is largely about the latter. Implementing a large project is as much or more about the former.

Q: How do you eat an elephant?
A: One bite at a time.
Addendum: Which bites are taken when is key to success.

Having handled a couple of items it's a good time to re-visit the task list - remove completed items, add new ones, and figure out priorities for next steps.
- advancement
- items & inventory
- the UI loop and timing
- mobs on the map (presence and interaction)
- mobs in general
- equipment
- key binding system
- help system (at the least, list available actions / commands)
- random tables (ways of selecting at random from a weighted and possibly dynamic set)
- entity event system (entity mixins can raise events and have handlers for events that are raised)
- entity repository (a way of organizing entity templates and getting entities generated from those templates)
- improved map generation and management

Now that there's a system for entities I think it's time to add an entity other than the avatar. This entity will be extremely simple - no actions, it just sits there. Having more than one entity sets up work on:
- map population
- persistence
- entity interaction (attacking / attack system)
- entity death/removal
- entity repository (a way of organizing entity templates and getting entities generated from those templates)
Basically, the next milestone is to have the map populated with some kind of very simple mob that the avatar can kill.

In supporting that I might also tackle
- entity event system (entity mixins can raise events and have handlers for events that are raised)

The UI loop needs to be in place before other entities can do anything - that's probably the next major milestone after this one, and will include some kind of mob that does something (i.e. VERY basic AI).

I think these also need to be handled fairly soon (partly to keep the screen uncluttered, and partly to have them in place before we start adding more commands), but probably not at this step
- key binding system
- help system
