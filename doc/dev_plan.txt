All projects, coding and otherwise, boil down to two fundamental questions- what should we do, and how should we do it? Learning computer programming is largely about the latter. Implementing a large project is as much or more about the former.

A: One bite at a time.
Addendum: Which bites are taken when is key to success.

Some of the tasks that would need to be done for a full game aren't really necessary for a base game, so I'm (at least for now) setting them aside. I'm also far enough along that I'm going to put a bit of thought into ordering the milestone list at this point.
Base game:
- items & active symbols
- inventory
- avatar info display (more than just map coords)
- item and entity descriptions; calculating item and entity stats for player viewing
- hunger, food, and eating
- looking at things (targeting)
- equipment
- improved map generation - random seeds for maps? seeding items? connected maps?
- treasure drops
Later:
- map modification - digging
- ongoing actions
- avatar advancement - experience and improvement
- game scoring
- random tables (ways of selecting at random from a weighted and possibly dynamic set)
- multiple maps and moving between them
- improved map tiles and generation - more tile types, variable digging
- throwing things & ranged combat
- improved combat mechanics
- ipad compatibility (capturing input, figuring out key bindings)

There are three large pieces to this next chunk of work:
- pulling mixin stuff out of entity and up a level (to an intermediary between Symbol and Entity)
- putting item code structures in place (similar to entities) and creating a first item
- altering the map to have items on it (and the render system to handle them)

Originally I'd lumped inventory stuff in with this, but I think that would make this milestone too large and diverse.

Inventory (which happens next, most likely) will cover:
- More new commands!-  pick up an item, drop an item (for this step 'inventory' will hold a single thing)
- Container item mixin, and using an item with that for the player's inventory
- new ui mode layer - inventory management (with new command!- manage inventory)
