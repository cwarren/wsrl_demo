Demonstration / reference code for the Rogue-like winter study course at Williams College.

Branches will be created at (hopefully) useful milestones in the development processes and these notes updated to indicate the specific things that branch achieves.

This branch is at the hello world stage. That is, it verifies that all the very basic pieces of the project work - the web page is viewable, the javascript file are loaded and run correctly, expected info is shown on the browser's JS console, the rot.js library can be used to create a console-like display which is shown on the web page, and something can be shown in that display.

At this stage the beginnings of larger structures and strategies sketched out
* there's a folder to put library (3rd party) js code
* custom js code is split across multiple files
* there's a Game namespace to isolate the work
* using rich / complicated data structures (i.e. array, hashes/objects, functions, etc., all potentially nested multiple levels)
* make significant use of the JS console in the development/debug process

The next step is to flesh out the UI a bit - better display, more complex display and interaction management, and actually interacting with the user.
