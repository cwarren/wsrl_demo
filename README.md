Demonstration / reference code for the Rogue-like winter study course at Williams College.

Branches will be created at (hopefully) useful milestones in the development processes and these notes updated to indicate the specific things that branch achieves.

This step puts the very basics of persistence, game save and game restore, into place. There's extremely little game state at the moment, just the random seed value, which makes this a good stage at which to implement this. From now on as game features are added any necessary persistence aspects of those pieces will also be implemented.
